== Principles

=== Basic artifacts

Entity:: An object that is identified by its consistent thread of continuity.

.Entity example (in UML, using profile annotation)
image:entity.svg[Entity] 

Value Object:: An immutable (unchangeable) object that has attributes but no distinct identity.

.Value Object example (in UML, using profile annotation)
image:valueObject.svg[Value Object] 

Domain Event:: An object that is used to record a discrete event related to model activity within the system. 

TIP: Since they model something in the past, events are normally immutable objects.

Aggregate:: A cluster of entities and value objects with defined boundaries around the group. 

TIP: An aggregate should have a unique root (an Entity generally), through wich all interaction with objects of the aggregate should go.

.Aggregate example (in UML, using profile annotation)
image:aggregate.svg[Aggregate] 

Service:: Essentially, a service is an operation or form of business logic that doesn’t naturally fit within the realm of objects. 


.Service example (in UML, using profile annotation)
image:service.svg[Service] 


Repositories::  a service that uses a global interface to provide access to all entities and value objects that are within a particular aggregate collection. 

WARNING: Not to be confused with common version control (e.g., `git`) repositories

Factories:: encapsulates the logic of creating complex objects and aggregates, ensuring that the client has no knowledge of the inner-workings of object manipulation.

Modules:: logical groupings of classes (by functionnalities rather than by implementation).
