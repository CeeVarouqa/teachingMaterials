== Assessment and rating of sprints

Each Sprint (week) is evaluated by a TA.
The evaluation will address 5 criteria and will take the following form:

These 5 criteria are taken from a course on software quality from my Bordeaux colleague, Xavier Blanc (https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev):

WARNING: Sorry for the French in the following explanations.

User values:: the way the goals have been captured (more details link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/issue[here])

US/Tasks:: the way Goals, US and tasks are linked and trace link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/tache[here])

Documentation:: Technical and user documentations (more details link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/doc[here])

Tests/Quality:: How well are supported/explained the verification activities (more details link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/test[here]). I have integrated in this criterion a 6th thar Xavier is using, "Source code", where he evaluates quality attributes (more details link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/code[here]).

Build/CI/Release:: How professional and automated are the build, automated testing, deploy (more details link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/release[here])

== Project classical evaluation sheet

Here is the provisional scale:

[align="center", width="90%", cols="6,^1", options="header"]
|==========================================================
| Criterion | %
| Respect for the Scrum method | 20%
| "Professional" character of dev | 20%
| Successive deliveries | 20%
| Tests / Documentations / Readme / wiki | 20%
| Code and application quality | 10%
| Final Customer Satisfaction | 10%
|==========================================================

TIP: I advise you to add such a table in your readme and self-evaluate your project.
