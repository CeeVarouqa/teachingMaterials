== Assessment and rating of sprints

Each Sprint (week) is evaluated by a TA.
The evaluation will address 5 criteria and will take the following form:

.The initial 6 artifacts (Source https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/[here])

NOTE: These artifacts come from a course on software quality from my colleague Xavier Blanc (https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev).

WARNING: Sorry for the French in the linked explanations.

=== User values

- The way the goals have been captured (more details link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/issue[here])
- Evaluated by the _Product Owner_
- Should never decrease
- Sometimes no, or low, added value (Spikes, refactoring sprints)

=== US/Tasks

- The way Goals, US, and tasks are linked and traced link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/tache[here])
- Very tool-dependent (e.g., blocking issues, task lists, ...)
- Can (should?) reach a high level pretty early

=== Documentation

- Technical and user documentations (more details link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/doc[here])
- As much automated as possible (javadoc, `.md`/`.adoc`, ...)

=== Tests/Quality

- How well are supported/explained the verification activities (more details link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/test[here])
- Address and differentiate unit tests and integration tests

=== Build/CI/Release

- How professional and automated are the build, automated testing, deploy (more details link:https://github.com/xblanc33/QualiteDev/blob/master/release[here])
- Can (should?) reach a high level pretty early

== Project typical evaluation sheet

Here is the provisional scale:

[align="center", width="90%", cols="6,^1", options="header"]
|==========================================================
| Criterion | %
| Respect for the Scrum method | 20%
| "Professional" character of dev | 20%
| Successive deliveries | 20%
| Tests / Documentations / Readme / wiki | 20%
| Code and application quality | 10%
| Final Customer Satisfaction | 10%
|==========================================================

TIP: I advise you to add such a table in your readme and self-evaluate your project.

== Useful tips

=== Technical Debt

Software Engineering term for _Procrastination_!

image::techDebt.png[width=20%]

=== Commit messages

Have the same policy in the project:

`[Fix|Feature|...] [Issue_Number]: Use a sentence with a capital letter and verb for the first word.`

=== Use badges

=== Comments in code

Avoid useless comments!
